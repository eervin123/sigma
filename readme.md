# Daily sigma trading Repo
This was an initial notebook that I'm using to learn Vectorbt and share/teach othere.

The file [daily_sigma.ipynb](daily_sigma.ipynb) walks through how to set up multiple standard deviations then create buy and sell signals and backtest a hypothetical portfolio simulation. I was looking for a strategy that would have thousands and thousands of trades so I could filter it down and work with overlapping signals, etc. 

It wasn't the purpose of this exercise, but hey, the results are pretty promising. ![Simulation](simulation.png)
